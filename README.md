#I am building a music guesser project in Python using Django. This is going to be web based, dont mind all the garbae im fairly new to this and im just trying to gain knowledge. That being said, this app will be a trivia like game where you pick a music genre then you pick a difficuly level and then after it randomly picks a song with a 10 second snippet and you have to answer on who sang it and whats the music title.
